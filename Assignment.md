## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

**What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**

1. `Concept: Git Branching`

`Expectation ðŸ‘€`: Just a way to make copies of code.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: A powerful feature for isolating features and experiments without affecting the main code. Learned how to create, switch, and merge branches effectively.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: Helped me develop new features like the 3D text animation and color controls independently without breaking the working version.

2. `Concept: Pull Requests`

`Expectation ðŸ‘€`: Just clicking a button to merge code.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: A collaborative code review process that helps catch issues early and maintain code quality.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: Used PRs to properly integrate new features like zoom controls and UI improvements with proper documentation.

3. `Concept: Project Boards`

`Expectation ðŸ‘€`: Another complex project management tool.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: An intuitive way to visualize and track tasks, making project progress clear and manageable.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: Helped organize portfolio development into clear tasks like "Add 3D Text", "Implement Controls", etc.

4. `Concept: Issue Management`

`Expectation ðŸ‘€`: Just a bug tracker.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: A comprehensive system for planning features, tracking bugs, and documenting decisions.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: Used issues to plan and track each portfolio feature, linking them to PRs and milestones.
